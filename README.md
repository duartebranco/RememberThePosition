# Remember the Position

This is a challenge of remembering the exact position of the chess pieces in midlegames/endgames after having 10 seconds to memorize them.

I was inspired to do this after coming across some studies that reached the conclusion that masters can recall more pieces than a beginner if it's a typical, possible and legal position.

The studies in question:
- [Recall of random and distorted chess positions: Implications for the theory of expertise](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03200937.pdf)
- [Recall memory for visually presented chess positions](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03213216.pdf)
